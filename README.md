# Mavtern- A Internship portal built on Codeigniter platform
Internships For Students

The main purpose of our project by the end of semester is to deliver a website which provides opportunities for UTA (community) students to apply for available Internships and company recruiters to update the Internship postings. Students will be able to look for companies that are providing internships and at the same time companies can search for the students who are seeking opportunities. 
Our website will have three users with three specific user roles. 1) Website administrator who is responsible for monitoring the website in order to control spam, inappropriate posts, and the creation/deletion of users. 2) Company recruiter who will be able to post jobs with specific requirements and details and review student resumes and applications. 3) Lastly our website will have students from different communities who can create a profile which describes their area of interest and skills. Also students will have the feasibility to upload their resume as well as search for internship/job openings. Student will have the company recruiter details (Email, Phone number etc.) which helps the student to communicate with company recruiter for further details on job/internship postings.
As an additional feature we will include a recommendation engine, which provides job suggestions based on the areas of interests and skills of the student provided. Also student will be provided with an option to search for jobs based on criteria such as location and salary.
For security and verification purposes, students can only create accounts with a valid UTA student ID and email address and recruiters can only create accounts with a valid company details such as email address and phone number.
However, our website will be specific to UTA student communities which will help recruiters narrow their searches and increase the likelihood that UTA students can find the perfect match.
Our website will be designed with a modern perspective in mind; it will be adaptive-responsive, so that it can be viewed from any device. It will run on different browsers. It will be written in web-based languages: HTML5, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and we will use an SQL database.
